Example: https://www.selenium.dev

Requirements:

Navigate to the homepage.
Check the navigation menu (e.g., Documentation, Projects, Support).
Ensure each link leads to the correct URL.
Use assertEqual to verify URLs.


2. Testing Login Functionality with Multiple Scenarios
Objective: Test different login scenarios (valid/invalid).
Example: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login

Requirements:

Test login with valid credentials.
Test login with a valid username and incorrect password.
Test login with empty fields.
Validate the displayed error messages.


3. Testing Advanced Search on an E-Commerce Website
Objective: Test the search functionality with filters on an e-commerce website.
Example: https://www.ebay.com

Requirements:

Search for a product, such as "laptop."
Apply filters for price and category.
Verify that the displayed results meet the selected criteria.



4. Testing Pop-up Windows and JavaScript Alerts
Objective: Verify the site's behavior when pop-up windows or alerts appear.
Example: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/javascript_alerts

Requirements:

Open the page with JavaScript alerts.
Click on each button and handle the alerts.
Verify that the alert messages are correct.


5. Testing Responsive Design (Different Window Sizes)
Objective: Ensure that website elements are displayed correctly on different window sizes.
Example: https://www.selenium.dev

Requirements:

Set different sizes for the browser window.
Check if the navigation menu and buttons are visible.



6. Testing Pages with Dynamic Content (Lazy Loading)
Objective: Verify the loading of elements on pages using lazy loading.
Example: https://www.infinite-scroll.com/demo/full-page/

Requirements:

Scroll down the page to load additional content.
Verify that elements are displayed correctly after scrolling.


7. Verifying Elements that Require Hover (Mouse Over)
Objective: Test the behavior of elements that activate when the mouse hovers over them.
Example: https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/hovers

Requirements:

Hover over each image and check if additional information appears.
Ensure that links become visible after hovering.


8. Testing Pages with Infinite Scrolling
Objective: Verify that pages with infinite scrolling load content correctly.
Example: https://www.endlessscrolling.com

Requirements:

Scroll down to the end of the content.
Check if new elements load with each scroll.




9 . Objective:
Verify that the website handles JavaScript alerts and pop-up windows correctly.

Test Scenario:
Navigate to the website: Open https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/javascript_alerts.
Trigger different JavaScript alerts:
Click the button that generates a simple alert().
Click the button that generates a confirm() box and select "Cancel".
Click the button that generates a prompt() box, enter text, and confirm.
Verify the expected behavior:
Ensure that the alert box appears.
Check that dismissing the confirmation box works correctly.
Verify that entering text in the prompt box updates the page accordingly.
Close the browser.
Requirements:
Use Selenium WebDriver for automation.
Implement the test using Python and unittest.
Ensure the test validates the presence and content of alert messages.
Handle exceptions gracefully and log meaningful error messages.
Expected Outcome:
The test should confirm that JavaScript alerts appear as expected and that user actions (accept/dismiss/input text) affect the page correctly.
